I proudly and excitedly write today to announce the
formation of `rust-edu`: an organization providing a hub and
a set of initiatives for strongly supporting Rust education
in the academic environment. While we are initially focused
on colleges and university learning, in the longer term we
hope to broaden our scope.

We have identified three types of initiative that we want to
take on with this project.

* Our initial major driver is an effort to create modular
  turnkey Rust curriculum for University Computer Science
  courses. This of course includes the teaching of Rust
  itself, but we want to do more. Specifically, we want to
  build Rust-based course modules and whole courses covering
  traditional Computer Science topics such as Operating
  Systems, Embedded Development, Networking, etc. We are
  even exploring what a Introductory Programming course in
  Rust would look like.

  It's going to take a lot of work by a lot of skilled
  people to make progress. We think the Rust community is up
  to the challenge, and that this will have an important
  impact on computing in both the short and long term.

* We want to take advantage of the growing interest in
  building tools that make learning and mastering Rust
  easier. We believe that the notorious difficulty curve of
  the language can be overcome: better tooling for education
  and development looks like a key thing to do there.

* We want to feed our insights and work back into the Rust
  Project itself, helping to make Rust a more learnable
  language easier for new developers to work with. We would
  like to identify places where we can help with
  documentation, learning exercises, error messages, and the
  like to make Rust a learner-friendly language.

The beauty of open source is that working with academia is
extremely valuable for both sides. We are committed to
promote the adoption of Rust throughout the academic
world. We believe that we can work with the Rust community
to provide tools and educational support for technology
students and faculty to learn and build in new and better
ways, while also helping to drive the adoption of Rust as a
key technology for decades to come. We want to take the
loose network of people and resources available today and
provide focus and support, in an environment that warmly
welcomes all of those who wish to work and play in this
grand endeavor.

Success is not cheap: we are extraordinarily grateful to
FutureWei, Inc for funding this initial work. Just as
important as money, though, is people. You. If you are
involved in Rust and academia, or would like to be, we would
love to have your help. Please visit our web home at
