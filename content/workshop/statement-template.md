# My Thoughts On Rust Education *(put your title here)*
Rust Education Workshop 2020

*(sample text)* I think Rust is pretty neat. It would be
great if more University Computer Science classes used the
language: not just teaching Rust, but using it in classes
throughout the CS curriculum.

It is hard to get Rust into CS courses for a bunch of
reasons. I do not know how to solve this problem myself,
although I have some ideas. A first step might be to gather
a bunch of folks interested in Rust education for a Workshop
where they can exchange ideas and plan together.  We could
also figure out how we could help to improve Rust learning
in general: for example, improving the Rust language and
tools to make learning easier.

I hope this idea will take off. I think Rust-based education
can move faster if we all work together.
