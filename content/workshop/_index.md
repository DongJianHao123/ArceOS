## Call For Participation

*Conference Date:* Saturday 20 August 2022  
*Submission Deadline (see below):* Wednesday 16 August 2022

The [Rust-Edu](http://rust-edu.org) Org is pleased to
announce the 2022 Rust Education Workshop, a one-day virtual
meeting to discuss the future of Rust education. If you are
involved with Rust in an educational capacity, or would like
to be, we would love to have you participate and
share. Lecturers and professors, Rust authors and trainers,
developers of tools supporting Rust learning, Rust language
developers looking to improve learnability, and anyone
trying to expand the scope and quality of Rust learning and
teaching are especially welcome.

The Workshop will be streamed live to the general public and
recorded for later viewing; the Workshop Proceedings will be
published online.

### Topics

Topics of interest to us include (but are not limited to):

* The future of Rust as a language of choice in college CS
  education. We are particularly interested in the use of
  Rust as a teaching language in courses that are not
  directly language related: for example operating systems,
  networking, or embedded programming. We are also
  interested in the future potential of Rust as an early CS
  teaching language.

* Tool-driven and content-driven methods for improving Rust
  learning in general: for example tools for improving Rust
  code understanding, enhancements to existing tools to aid
  Rust learnability, or Rust teaching and tutoring content
  and frameworks.

* Possible enhancements to the Rust language and Rust
  Project tooling to improve learnability.

### Participating

The Rust Education Workshop is free-of-charge: the price of
Workshop attendance is a submission describing your
interests. You may submit one of the following:

* A one-page PDF position statement on a topic broadly
  related to Rust education. Position statement will be
  reviewed for suitability and accepted statements will be
  published as part of the Workshop Proceedings. Statements
  should have a title and the author(s) name and contact
  email. We are not too concerned about the format, but it
  would be good to roughly follow the style of the sample
  [here](/workshop/statement-template.pdf) when preparing the PDF.

* PDF of slides for a 20-minute proposed talk on a topic
  related to Rust education. Selected applicants will be
  asked to present their talk at the Workshop.

* A PDF paper of up to five pages in
  [ACM Conference Format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)
  to be refereed by the conference organizers. If the paper
  is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a 20-minute
  talk for the Workshop as above. Selected applicants will
  be asked to present their talk at the Workshop. Accepted
  papers will be published in the Workshop Proceedings.

To participate in the Workshop, please email your name
including preferred pronouns, contact information including
email and phone number, submission materials, and agreement
to abide by the Workshop Code of Conduct (see below) to
